📖 Project Overview

This application serves as a comprehensive tool for marketing data analysis. It addresses the common challenge of fragmented campaign data by providing a unified interface to:

Generate realistic synthetic data (simulating 5+ digital channels).

Clean "dirty" data using an automated pipeline (handling duplicates, nulls, and formatting errors).

Visualize performance via interactive dashboards (ROI, CTR, Spend Efficiency).

Automate reporting by generating download-ready CSV summaries.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering and analysis skills, from data creation to stakeholder reporting.

✨ Key Features

Data Simulation Engine: Generates realistic datasets with baked-in seasonality, weekend trends, and channel-specific logic (e.g., higher CPC for LinkedIn, higher volume for Facebook).

Interactive Data Cleaning: A module that allows users to intentionally inject noise (duplicates, errors) and then run a cleaning pipeline to fix it in real-time.

Dynamic Dashboards: Built with Plotly for interactive zooming and filtering on metrics like ROI, Conversion Rates, and CPC.

Automated Reporting: One-click generation of monthly executive summary reports, reducing manual analysis time.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core logic and data processing.

Streamlit: Web application framework and frontend UI.

Pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation.

Plotly: Interactive data visualization.

NumPy: Statistical operations and synthetic data generation.
